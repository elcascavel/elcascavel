Hey 👋, Simão Amaral here!
=============================
I'm currently on my third year of bachelor's in Communication and Multimedia @ UTAD in Portugal. It covers a plethora of topics but I found a passion in web development. I am also interested in game development and reverse engineering. I've only programmed a little Snake clone with C++ however. The rest of my projects are web dev related.

* 🧠  I'm learning React.
